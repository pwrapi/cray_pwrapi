Every file in this directory is a single test that tests cnctl's JSON
interface.  Together as a whole they should represent all possible valid
JSON input packets.  A few examples on how to run these:

	cat cap_val.PWR_ATTR_FREQ_LIMIT_MAX | cnctl -j
	cat get.PWR_ATTR_all | cnctl -j
	cat set.PWR_ATTR_CSTATE_LIMIT | cnctl -j
