The pwrtest command is a client of PowerAPI, providing a tool to test the
PowerAPI library. The postmortem command consumes the output of pwrtest and
creates a more useful debugging output, in the event that pwrtest has any
failures.

The pwrtest command uses linenoise, a small self-contained alternative
to readline and libedit, for command line editing during interactive
operation. The linenoise source is included as a git-subtree in the
pwrtest source code.

The remote repository for linenoise is:

	https://github.com/antirez/linenoise.git

The subtree is maintained under the pwrtest source at:

	deps/linenoise



WORKING WITH SUBTREES
---------------------

Some information about subtrees:

1. The subtree is part of the stash project. Developers donâ€™t have to do
anything special when cloning the source, prior to building.

2. A copy of the subtree code is stored in the stash project. Building
the source is not dependent upon the continued existence of the remote
repository that was the source for the subtree.

3. If the subtree needs to be updated to the remote repository it was
cloned from, the git-subtree command has subcommands to do this (see
get-subtree(1) in the man pages):

	git subtree pull  -P <prefix> <repository> <ref> 
	git subtree merge -P <prefix> <commit>

4. If the subtree has a change that needs to be provided to the remote
repository it was cloned from, the git-subtree command has subcommands
to do this (see get-subtree(1) in the man pages):

	git subtree push -P <prefix> <repository> <ref> 
	git subtree split -P <prefix> [OPTIONS] [<commit>]

5. Developers should avoid commits that contain changes to the container
projects and the subtree. A commit should only contain changes either to
the subtree or the container project. If a commit contains both it
should be split into multiple commits.
