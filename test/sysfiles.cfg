# All paths have hardcoded default values. Unless modified here, the hardcoded
# paths are used. This file is intended only for testing error paths.
#
# Blank lines are ignored.
# Lines beginning with '#' are ignored as comments.
# Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored, including comment lines.
# Whitespace and/or '=' is required between the name and the path.
#
# Individual path descriptors can be uncommented and modified. You must preserve
# the number, order, and exact type of all printf format conversions (e.g. '%lu').
# Any other information can be modified.
#
# Uncommenting the 'chroot' line will cause all path descriptors not explicitly
# specified be prefixed with the chroot directory. The chroot is ignored for all
# path descriptors explicitly specified.
